					in enrolling into a milestone and those that are used in fulfilling a milestone. pass_logic can either be AND or OR. When it's AND all the conditions in the fields must be fulfilled and when OR either 
					of the fields values will lead to executing the action. enrollment_fields define the conditions that must be met for someone to enroll into a milestone from the events specified in the types key",
